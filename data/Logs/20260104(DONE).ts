[ISSUE]:
        Relation(A):
        [IFlow] [0x310-0] => [0x310-1]
        [0x310-0] is a kind of [0x310-1]
        Relation(B):
        [IFlow] [0x327-0] => [0x327-1]
        [0x327-0] is a kind of [0x327-1]

⚠️[WARNING]: the Relations above are totally identical and that is invalid
🚀[solution]: modify the createGrid() FUNCTION
